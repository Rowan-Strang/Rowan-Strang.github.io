        What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize the emotions in ourselves and in others, and understand where they are coming from and what they are driving towards.
<br><br>
        Emotional intelligence can be as simple as recognizing that you are angry. Heightened emotional intelligence would involve understanding what made you angry and determining if it is what you are actually upset about.
        <br><br>
        Emotional intelligence also extends to recognizing or reading these things in other people.
        <br><br>
        Recognizing that someone is upset or disappointed, even if they may be hiding it or presenting a different emotion entirely, clairvoyant emotional intelligence would involve knowing why the person is upset or disappointed, and having the tools to manipulate that for good or ill.

        How is EQ different from IQ?
      </h2>

      <p>
        IQ is a measure of someoneâ€™s reasoning, logical, and calculating abilities, including cognitive and intellectual skills, knowledge retention, and analytical thinking.

      <h2>
        Why is EQ important?
      </h2>
      <p>
        EQ is important as it allows you to better manage yourself and others in all areas of life. High EQ provides you with robust tools to navigate your own complex sets of feelings and emotions, making you a more effective human.
<br><br>
        Recognizing that humans are a social species reframes EQ as an essential tool in a social world.
