      <p>The emphasis on human skills within the Dev Academy curriculum was initially surprising, given the technical nature of programming and development. However, upon reflection, it makes sense to focus on developing interpersonal skills alongside technical capabilities, as these are crucial for collaborative work environments. The academy's approach, which integrates human skills into the learning process, is designed to enhance the employability of its graduates and foster effective teamwork among students who learn in a class-based setting. This approach acknowledges that while one could potentially acquire similar technical skills through self-directed online learning, the in-person, socially interactive learning environment at Dev Academy offers a unique opportunity to develop as a co-worker and social being.</p>

      <p>The human skills curriculum has led to several personal discoveries and challenges, particularly in the areas of empathy, self-awareness, and communication. Learning to take breaks and seek help when facing difficulties has been an important lesson in self-care and efficiency. Despite the struggle with introspection and recognizing personal social deficiencies, the importance of such skills in a professional setting cannot be overstated. The academy's focus on human skills is justified as it prepares students not only to be proficient developers but also to be well-rounded individuals who are attractive to potential employers. The acknowledgment of the value in these soft skills, despite a personal preference for more technical learning, reflects a balanced approach to education that fosters both personal and professional growth.</p>
