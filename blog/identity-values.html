    <p>
      Hello everyone! I’m Rowan Strang. Today, I want to share some insights
      into my identity and values. (I really struggled with this task)
      <br />
      <br />
      <em
        >Disclosure... I answered the questions in sprint 1, in a series of
        poorly constructed simple answers. I've since fed those back through
        Chat-GPT for the following more redable blog post</em
      >
      <br />
      <br />

      <b>Integrity and Honesty</b><br />
      Honesty is very important to me, even though it can sometimes put me in
      tough spots. For example, if I found a wallet with money, I might take the
      money but ensure the wallet gets to the police so the owner can recover
      it. This shows a practical side of me. I think about personal benefit but
      also try to do the right thing by helping the wallet’s owner get their
      belongings back. ultimatly though the amount of money in the wallet, the
      type of wallet and other judgements i make based on the wallet would
      inform my decision. <br /><br />

      <b>Compassion and Empathy</b><br />
      I’m the type of person who helps others when they ask for it, like helping
      someone at the supermarket. I may not go out of my way to find people to
      help, but I’m always ready to assist when someone needs me right there and
      then. <br /><br />

      <b>Responsibility and Procrastination</b><br />
      I’ll admit, I tend to put off tasks I don’t enjoy until the last minute.
      This approach allows me to work when I feel most ready, balancing my
      personal comfort with the need to get things done. It’s a practical way of
      handling responsibilities, especially when I’m not excited about the tasks
      at hand. <br /><br />

      <b>Fairness</b><br />
      I believe in fairness, but I’m also realistic about group dynamics.
      Sometimes, I’m okay with sharing credit with people who might not have
      contributed as much. Although it bothers me a bit, I compromise to keep
      things harmonious. This shows that while I value fairness, I’m also
      willing to bend a little to maintain peace. <br /><br />

      <b>Courage and Advocacy</b><br />
      I haven’t often been in situations where I needed to stand up for someone
      being treated unfairly. This might mean I’m either not in environments
      where this is common, or I’m cautious about getting involved. However, I’m
      always ready to support fairness and justice when the situation clearly
      calls for it. <br /><br />

      <b>Independence and Adaptability</b><br />I highly value my independence
      and ability to adapt to new situations. Being self-employed for over a
      decade has taught me how to manage myself and thrive under changing
      conditions. However, this same independence sometimes makes it challenging
      for me to stay focused, especially when I’m not passionate about the task
      at hand. <br /><br />

      <b>Generosity and Sustainability</b><br />
      I believe in generosity and think it’s important to consider the greater
      good over personal gain, particularly when it comes to sustainability.
      This belief guides my actions, from how I run my business to my everyday
      decisions. I try to balance my needs with the impact of my actions on the
      community and the environment. <br /><br />

      <b>Cultural Influence and Personal Growth</b> Growing up, I was taught to
      respect all cultures and identities, which has become a natural part of
      who I am. However, my background and experiences have also made me aware
      of my biases, especially regarding gender, stemming from attending an
      all-boys school. Recognizing these biases has been crucial in my personal
      growth, helping me strive to be more understanding and inclusive.
      <br /><br />

      <b>Looking Ahead</b><br />
      As I continue my journey at Dev Academy, I’m excited to meet new people
      and dive deeper into the tech world, turning my passions into practical
      skills. This new chapter is not just about professional growth but also
      about personal development, as I navigate my values and identity in this
      changing landscape. I believe that understanding and articulating one’s
      values is a journey in itself, one that requires honesty, reflection, and
      a willingness to adapt and grow. I’m eager to see where this path takes me
      and how my values will evolve with the new experiences ahead.
