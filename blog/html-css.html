      <p>
        In making a website, there are three special tools called <b>margin</b>, <b>border</b>, and <b>padding</b> that help decide how much space each part of the website takes up.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially, I couldn‚Äôt grasp this concept; I felt like such an idiot. That‚Äôs why I chose this topic to spell out clearly in this blog, so that I will no longer feel like such an idiot.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before we talk about margins, borders, and padding, we need to think about content. Content is all the stuff you see on a website like words, pictures, videos, and buttons. Everything we do when we make a website is to show this content nicely.‚Äù <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This is where the margins, borders, and padding come in. Let‚Äôs start with borders.
        <br />
       </p>
    </div>

    <div class="columnLayout">
      <h2>
        Borders
      </h2>

      <p>
        A border is like a picture frame around what you see on a website, like words or pictures. You can make the frame thick or thin and choose its color. The frame helps make things look separate from everything else, but it doesn‚Äôt make space around them. To make space, we use something called margins.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnLayout">
      <h2>
        Margin
      </h2>

      <p>
        The margin surrounds the border, like a border for the border. The difference is the margin is transparent and therefore cannot be colored. The margin exists to create space between different elements.
<br>
<br>
        However, a margin can also have a negative value, which would let you bring two elements closer together or even have them overlap.
      <br>
      <br>
      At this point, you might think, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, the border surrounds the element, and the margin keeps them both distanced from other elements.‚Äù

      But what if I want to control the space between the content and the border?
      
      And now you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôve covered borders and margins‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs probably that mysterious padding thing. Right?‚Äù
      
      Well, look who‚Äôs no longer an idiot!
<br>

      
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnLayout">
      <h2>
        Padding Baby!!!
      </h2>

      <p>
        The padding is a way to control the space between the content and the surrounding border.
<br>
<br>
        But you figured that out already, didn‚Äôt you? üòä
    <br>
    <br>    
        What you might not know is that, unlike the margin, the padding can be colored or styled to match the background color of the element.
<br>

    </div>
    <div class="columnLayout">
      <h2>
        In Summary
      </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Content:</b> The actual ‚Äústuff‚Äù inside the element, like text or images.</li>
          <li><b>Padding:</b> Surrounds the content.</li>
          <li><b>Border:</b> Surrounds the padding (and content)</li>
          <li><b>Margin:</b> Outside the border, separating the element from others.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Learning and using these special tools lets people who make websites put everything in just the right place. This makes sure that everything looks good and has enough space on the website.
