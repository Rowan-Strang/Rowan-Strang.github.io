        <p><strong>Human Skills Tasks</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> is the process by which practice makes permanent. The more you do something, the easier it becomes. In learning, this means that repeated actions strengthen the neural pathways in your brain, making those actions easier to complete over time.</p>
        
        <p>Neuroplasticity fundamentally represents the idea that the brain can change and be reshaped through behavior.</p>
        
        <p>It benefits individuals by providing a concept to grasp—learning can be difficult, frustrating, and uncomfortable, but understanding that this discomfort is beneficial for the brain can be reassuring. With persistent effort, tasks that once required conscious thought become second nature.</p>
        
        <p>For my own benefit, this emphasizes the importance of coding every day. The quickest way to become a proficient developer is to practice, practice, practice, and code frequently—even if it's not for long periods at a time.</p>
        
        <p>I found this resource interesting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJL3gjc8ak" style="color: blue;">Improving our neuroplasticity | Dr. Kelly Lambert</a></p>
        
        <p><strong>Growth Mindset</strong> is similar and complements the concept of neuroplasticity. It’s a mindset where challenges and setbacks are positive, where failure is a valid form of learning and self-improvement.</p>
        
        <p>Growth mindset focuses on praising and rewarding effort rather than the results of that effort.</p>
        
        <p>More good info here: <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means" style="color: blue;">What Having a “Growth Mindset” Actually Means
          by Carol Dweck</a></p>
        
        <p>I intend to fully attune to the growth mindset by accepting that my frustrations and failures are an essential part of becoming a competent developer.</p>
        
        <p>My growth mindset is vital to ensuring active neuroplasticity. In 10 years' time, everything I struggle with today will come as second nature.</p>
