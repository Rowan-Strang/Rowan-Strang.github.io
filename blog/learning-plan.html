      <b> Long Term Goal or Career Pathway:</b><br />
      My long-term goal is to develop and sell apps that enhance user
      experiences and address market needs. In the medium term, I aim to secure
      part-time employment as a full-stack web developer. My immediate goal is
      to relaunch my own business website using my own code and hosting,
      creating a platform that not only showcases my skills but also opens up
      new business opportunities and provides a superior experience for my
      clients. <br /><br />

      <b>Strengths and Limitations in Learning:</b><br />
      I am highly motivated and engaged when I find the subject matter
      intriguing, capable of immersing myself for hours to enhance my skills and
      perfect my processes. However, as a self-employed freelancer, my main
      challenge is maintaining discipline. I often struggle to stay on task when
      I’m not intrinsically motivated to work. <br /><br />

      <b>Skills Development:</b><br />
      I am eager to develop a more consistent 9-5 work ethic at Dev Academy.
      Given my background as a freelancer, working within a structured schedule
      will be a valuable skill as I transition into more collaborative
      environments. I also look forward to enhancing my teamwork abilities,
      which have not been a focus in my recent professional experiences.
      <br /><br />

      <b>Managing Workload:</b> <br />
      I commit to actively managing my workload and ensuring productive and safe
      interactions with peers, facilitators, and industry/community
      representatives. I recognize that staying ahead of my tasks is crucial for
      my mental well-being and effectiveness. My strategy is to avoid
      procrastination at all costs—considering myself “behind” if I’m merely on
      time, and “on time” if I’m ahead. <br /><br />

      <b>Handling Stress and Overload:</b><br />
      When I feel overwhelmed, I will take proactive steps to manage stress,
      such as going for a 30-minute run at the gym next door. This physical
      activity has proven effective in managing my stress and will be an
      integral part of my routine. <br /><br />

      <b>Seeking Help:</b><br />
      I vow to improve how I seek assistance, particularly from classmates and
      facilitators. I will not hesitate to ask for help when needed, ensuring
      that I address challenges before they become overwhelming. <br /><br />

      <b>Expectations from the Facilitation Team:</b> <br />
      I expect the facilitation team to create a supportive and inclusive
      environment where I can safely make mistakes and learn from them. Their
      guidance will be crucial as I navigate new concepts and strive to apply
      them effectively. <br /><br />

      <b>Scheduling and Commitments:</b><br />
      I have minimal external commitments, except for occasional meetings at 7pm
      and one scheduled Friday off towards the end of the course for a job
      commitment. While there is a possibility of needing to attend to a
      short-term shoot during the main bootcamp, my primary focus and commitment
      will be to my learning and development. I plan to keep my weekends free to
      ensure I have ample time for rest and recovery. <br /><br />
