<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  In the latest sprint of my full-stack web development course at Dev Academy, I've encountered a variety of challenges that have tested my problem-solving skills. From grappling with JavaScript functions to embedding functions within objects, each hurdle has offered a unique opportunity to deepen my understanding and refine my approach to coding.</p>
  <p><strong>Blocked on a Simple Problem</strong><br>
  One of the significant challenges I faced was understanding the <code>.map()</code> function in JavaScript. Despite its seeming simplicity, I struggled to grasp its application. Through a combination of Google searches, YouTube tutorials, and assistance from ChatGPT, I pushed through the overwhelming frustration. This experience taught me the importance of persistence and the value of utilizing multiple resources to tackle coding problems.</p>
  <p><strong>Elegantly Solved Problem</strong><br>
  A breakthrough moment came when I was tasked with creating a function inside an object—a concept that initially seemed daunting. By exploring various resources and applying what I learned, I successfully implemented the function, which not only expanded my understanding of JavaScript objects but also boosted my confidence in my coding abilities.</p>
  <p><strong>Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques</strong><br>
  While I am growing more comfortable with experimenting and "trying something" when faced with a problem, I recognize the need to integrate pseudocode more effectively into my workflow, especially as the complexity of projects increases. Although I haven't yet tried the rubber ducky method, it's on my radar as a potential tool for future challenges.</p>
  <p><strong>Reluctance to Ask for Help</strong><br>
  This week, I didn’t find myself in a situation that required asking for help, as I managed to resolve issues relatively quickly. However, I am aware of the importance of seeking assistance when necessary to avoid unnecessary delays and ensure I continue learning efficiently.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
  Each sprint in this course brings new challenges and learning opportunities. As I continue to navigate the intricate world of coding, I am learning to balance independence with the judicious use of available resources. This journey is not just about coding—it's about developing a resilient, adaptable problem-solving mindset.</p>
